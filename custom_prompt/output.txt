### Summary of Meilavan

Meilavan is a young human wizard who participates in the martial arts tournament as a combatant. She is defeated by the party's spellcaster, Carolina, in the semifinal round.

---

#### 1. Basic Description & Appearance
*   **Race:** Human.
*   **Age:** Approximately 16 years old.
*   **Appearance:** Described as seeming "humana" (human) and "pequenininha" (very small/little).
*   **Attire & Gear:** She carries a spellbook and is noted to have "placas transparentes, assim... Parecia-te magia. Tipo uma armadura mágica" (transparent plates, like that... It seemed like magic to you. Like a magical armor), which is likely the visual effect of a spell like *Mage Armor*.

#### 2. Companions
*   **Familiar:** She has a pet **ferret** (a "furão" in Portuguese). The ferret is typically seen wrapped around her neck or shoulders ("no pescoço dela"). It is a non-combatant pet in the tournament fight.

#### 3. Abilities and Combat Style
*   **Class:** Wizard.
*   **Notable Spell:** Her most prominent and effective spell is **Sleep**. She used it to win her previous match in the tournament, which was against a creature made of stone ("Ela literalmente matou uma pedra" / "She literally killed a stone").
*   **Other Spells:**
    *   **Arcane Burst (or similar):** She attempts to cast a spell from her book that creates a force effect, but it fails or does nothing noticeable in her match against the party. The transcript is unclear on the exact name, but it is described as "Arcane Burst."
*   **Combat Performance:** In her fight against the party (Kael and Ara), she is defeated very quickly. She tries to hide behind sacks of flour at the start of the match, but is seen. Before she can take any significant action, Carolina casts *Sleep* and she, along with her ferret, falls unconscious, ending the combat.

#### 4. Personality and Motivation
*   **Polite and Humble:** After being awakened following her defeat, she is not bitter. She congratulates the party, saying "Bem jogada" (Well played) and admits the spell used on her was "bué fixe" (really cool).
*   **Motivation for Fighting:** Her primary reason for entering the dangerous tournament is **to win money to help her sick mother**. She explains, "A minha mãe está doente e eu queria usar o dinheiro..." (My mother is sick and I wanted to use the money...).
    *   **Mother's Illness:** Her mother is suffering from a mysterious and severe illness that is causing her skin to turn black ("a cara dela estava preta" / "her face was turning black"). This disease is mentioned by others in the city as being untreatable and ultimately fatal, driving Meilavan's desperation.
*   **Living Situation:** She lives in the poorer part of the city ("parte pobre") with her master (presumably her magic teacher) while her mother lives nearby.

#### 5. Interactions with the Party
*   **The Fight:** The encounter is brief. The party knows they will fight her and her ferret in the semifinals. The combat is resolved almost instantly by Carolina's *Sleep* spell.
*   **Post-Fight Conversation:** After her defeat, the party feels sympathy for her. They ask about her mother's illness and she explains her situation. The party considers helping her by finding a "raiz de suprino" (suprino root) which can supposedly delay the disease's effects, though it is not a cure. This leads to a discussion within the party about prioritizing her quest versus their other objectives.

In summary, Meilavan is a sympathetic, young, and motivated wizard who is pushed into a violent tournament by her mother's dire circumstances. She is quickly and decisively defeated by the party, who then learn about her personal plight and consider aiding her.
