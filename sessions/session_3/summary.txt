### Morning in the Castle

The party awoke in their servant's quarters in the castle. Freya spent time gathering sand for her spell components. The group decided their next step was to find the scribe [[Miguel]], whom they had learned about from the meeting transcripts, to get more information on the recent diplomatic tensions with [[Beshkarl]].

### Searching for Miguel

The party first went to the guardhouse to ask about Miguel's whereabouts but were directed to speak with [[Dolga]], the maid, instead. They returned to the castle and found Dolga, who did not know where Miguel lived. A guard eventually offered to lead them to Miguel's house.

### Conversation with Miguel

The party met the scribe [[Miguel]] at his home. He provided more context on the recent meeting between King Folo and the diplomats from Bescarlo. He confirmed the dispute was over tax revenue from the [[Golden Strait]], which the king refused to share with Bescarlo due to their use of slavery and discriminatory practices. Miguel described Bescarlo as a city built by dwarves, now divided into an upper city for the wealthy and a lower city (Low City) for the poor and criminals, reliant on slave labor. He also mentioned that from the port on a clear day, one can see Bescarlo across the strait.

### Visiting the Blacksmith

Ara wanted to acquire a new weapon. The party went to a blacksmith named [[Duarte]], a dwarf. After some negotiation, which involved Freya using the Prestidigitation cantrip to clean the moss off his walls, Ara traded her Morningstar and 4 gold pieces for a Longsword. Kael used the distraction to stealthily steal a Glaive from the shop.

### Journey to Bescarlo

Seeking passage to Bescarlo to investigate the assassination further, the party went to the docks. They spoke with a fisherman named [[Gumbroh]], who, after some persuasion from Freya (who offered their services as guards for his boat in lieu of payment), agreed to take them. The journey by boat took approximately two hours.

### Arrival in Bescarlo and Meeting with Thorkell

Upon arriving in Bescarlo's port, a crewmember guided the party through the city's backstreets to a safe house. They descended through a hidden hatch into the Low City. Kael, familiar with the city, led the party to the headquarters of his former assassin faction. There, they met [[Thorkell]], Kael's former mentor and a high-ranking member of the faction.

Thorkell revealed he could get them information on the [[Silencers]]—the assassins responsible for the king's death—but only if they participated in an upcoming unarmed fighting tournament organized by the faction. The prize for winning is either 100 gold pieces or a magic item. The party agreed to form two teams: Kael and Ara, and Fern and Freya. Their first matches are scheduled for later that day.

### The First Tournament Match (Kael and Ara)

Kael and Ara fought their first match against a team named the Tilda sisters. After a brief combat, Ara knocked one sister unconscious but chose to use her Lay on Hands ability to heal her slightly instead of killing her, causing both sisters to yield. The party won their first match.

### End of Session

The session ended with the party preparing for their next tournament match.
