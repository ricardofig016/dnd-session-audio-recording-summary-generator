The party (Fern, Freya, and Kael) were arrested by guards for leaving a wolf's head in a public area. They were taken to the guard station, fined 10 gold each, and sentenced to two nights in a cell.

Shortly after, a large explosion occurred nearby, shaking the prison and filling it with dust. Fern and Freya were temporarily blinded. Kael used his tools to pick the lock of his cell, freed himself, retrieved his belongings, and then freed the others after a brief negotiation for future refuge.

The group fled the prison and went to investigate the explosion in the town center. They found several injured people and burning debris. The explosion site had black powder marks and a strong smell of wine. They helped the injured and discovered the blast originated near Marta's shop.

They found Marta mortally wounded. Despite attempts to heal her, she died. Carolina took Marta's cat. Carolina also found a magical ring wrapped in cloth on Marta's body; the ring was previously locked but is now unlocked.

The party learned from guards that King Folio had been assassinated in his castle. In his study, they found his body and a bloody symbol on the wall, which Kael recognized as the insignia of an assassin's order from his homeland. Notes from a recent meeting revealed the king had been in disputes with diplomats from Beskar over taxes on ships passing through the Golden Strait.

Investigating a broken window in the castle, they found a rope leading down to the ground, suggesting an escape route for the assassin. Following this lead to the docks, they learned from a fisherman that a boat carrying wine merchants had departed hastily southward shortly after the explosion. One of the merchants was seen boarding just after the blast.

The party returned to the castle, where they spoke with the head maid. They learned the king's scribe, Miguel, was present at the meeting with the Beskar diplomats. They also found notes in the meeting room detailing the contentious discussion, where the king refused to fund a city built on "slavery and discrimination."

The session ended with the party deciding to take a long rest in a room provided by the castle staff.
