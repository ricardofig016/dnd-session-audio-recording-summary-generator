The character attempted to stealthily escape a barrel on a ship but failed, alerting a guard. They knocked out the guard with a non-lethal dagger attack and stole his clothes. Three other crew members were alerted and discovered the character. After a failed deception attempt, the character was captured.

The character was hooded, handcuffed, and transported in a cart to a prison. They were placed in a cell at the end of a corridor. In a cell across the corridor, the character perceived three other prisoners: a human in chainmail and two elves. The session ended with the character alone in their cell.
