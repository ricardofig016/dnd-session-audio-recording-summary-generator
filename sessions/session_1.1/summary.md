### The Failed Escape
The character attempted a stealthy escape from a barrel on the ship but failed, immediately alerting a nearby guard.

### The Confrontation
A confrontation ensued, resulting in the character knocking the guard unconscious with a non-lethal dagger attack and stealing his clothes. The commotion, however, alerted three other crew members who quickly arrived and discovered the character.

### Capture and Imprisonment
After a failed attempt to deceive the crew, the character was captured. They were hooded, handcuffed, and transported via cart to a prison. There, they were placed in a solitary cell at the end of a long corridor.

### New Surroundings
From their new cell, the character perceived three other prisoners in a cell across the corridor: a human adorned in chainmail and two elves. The session concluded with the character alone in their cell.
