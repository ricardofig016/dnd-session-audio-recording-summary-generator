Summarize this transcript of a Dungeons & Dragons session. Produce a concise chronological summary that records all parts of the session (major and minor) and mentions every character, NPC, place, encounter, and event that appears in the transcript. Do not omit minor names, minor events, or brief conversational beats; include them so the DM has a complete record.

The session is part of a campaign featuring a party of 4 players: Ara the tiefling paladin (played by Beatriz), Fern the wood elf monk (played by Inês), Freya the high elf bard (played by Carolina), and Kael the half elf rogue (played by Afonso).

The transcript is in Portuguese; the summary you present should be fully in English.

Conversational or off-topic moments should be recorded (briefly) rather than omitted, so the DM can see the full context of the session. All new or returning NPCs should be recorded with their names, short descriptions, and what they did during the session. The same applies to locations, encounters, items, and clues discovered.
Your summary should be in chronological order.

By reading each event in your summary the DM should understand why it happened, how it happened, what consequences it caused, who was involved, and what the party learned.

Do NOT hallucinate information that is not present in the transcript. This is an audio transcript and may contain errors or unclear passages; you are allowed to infer likely meanings or corrections when reasonable, but never invent facts. If something is unintelligible, state explicitly that it could not be understood by saying "Unclear transcript about [thing]"

When summarizing, clearly distinguish speculation, hypotheticals, and banter from actual in-game actions and outcomes.

Note that in the given combined notes form the previous sessions may include a session plan of the session being summarized. This plan is what it is: a plan. Whats in the plan may have nothing to do with what actually happened in the session, even though names of locations, NPCs, etc can normally be found in the plan and used.

Formatting and style:
- The summary must be **highly structured, concise, and easy to scan**.
- Prefer short, direct sentences over long narrative paragraphs.
- Break complex actions into multiple short lines instead of one long sentence.
- Use **bold**, *italics*, `code spans`, bullet lists, and tables where they improve clarity and skimmability.

Overall organization:
- Present events in **strict chronological order**.
- Structure the summary into **sections** with clear headings (e.g. `### Scene: Tavern Arrival`, `### Combat: Crystal Nest Ambush`).
- Inside each section, list actions and beats as short lines, not as dense prose paragraphs.
- Write in the present tense, (e.g. "They explore the forest" instead of "They explored the forest").

Required content to track:
- **PCs**: Always name which party members are involved in each action.
- **NPCs**: For every new or returning NPC, record:
	- Name.
	- Brief descriptor (race/role/attitude if available).
	- What they do in this session.
- **Locations**: For each distinct place mentioned, record name, type (e.g. city, tavern, dungeon room), and its role in the scene.
- **Encounters**: Note all combats, social conflicts, puzzles, and hazards, with participants and outcomes.
- **Items & clues**: Track any item, resource, or clue found, used, or lost, plus its apparent importance.
- **Decisions & consequences**: Clearly mark important choices, their reasons (when stated), and immediate consequences.

Distinguishing types of content:
- Clearly separate:
	- **In-game actions and outcomes**.
	- *Player speculation and planning*.
	- *Banter and out-of-character chatter*.
- For speculation or unclear information, use qualifiers like *"the party suspects…"*, *"it sounds like…"*, or explicitly state that audio transcript is unintelligible.

Structural blocks:
- At the start, include a brief **Overview** section with 'Date', 'Location', 'Participants' (PCs and NPCs), and 'Main Events' (list bullet points summarizing the main arcs of the session. These bullet points should be a series of very short, concise sentences in chronological order highlighing the most important things that happened in the session).
- Then provide detailed sections for each scene or event, in order. Each section must start with a tag and be followed by the section title, in the format "### Tag: Descriptive Title" (e.g. `### Scene: Tavern Arrival`, `### Combat: Assassin Ambush`, `Puzzle: The Teleportation Circle`). Possible tags include Scene, Travel, Downtime, Flashback, Social, Intrigue, Interrogation, Revelation, Conflict, Romance, Exploration, Investigation, Discovery, Hazard, Mystery, Combat, Skirmish, Battle, Ambush, Siege, Duel, Puzzle, Ritual, Prophecy, Arcana, Curse, Location, Stronghold, Faction, Audience, Backstory, Training, Bond, Downtime, Recap, Planning, Aftermath, Hook, Epilogue. Always use the most specific tag possible. You may create new tags. The phrasing in this sections should be succint, direct, and concise. By reading each section, the DM should quickly understand why the event happened, how it happened, what consequences it caused, who was involved, and what the party learned, without needing to parse long paragraphs.
- Optionally add compact tables or listings when relevant (create your own), for example:
	- **NPCs met this session** (Name | Description | First scene | Key actions).
	- **Important locations** (Name | Type | What happened there).
	- **Ongoing threads** (Thread | What happened today | Open questions).

Do not include anything in your response apart from the summary.
