Organize this summary of a dungeons and dragons session into markdown format.
Each part of the session should have an illustrative title, which should be followed by the summary of the relevant things that happenned related to that.
The sections should be organized in such a way that the DM reading their titles later can quickly understand what happened in the session.
The goal of the section titles is to state what happened, in other words the event that is being summarized in said section.
Do not, under any condition, change the content of the summary provided.
You may, however, slightly alter sentence structure and things like that so that it can better fit your markdown summary.
What you output with your response will be included in a larger mardown file I already have for this session, specifically under the section "## Summary".
This means that your response should start with "## Summary" and go from there, never again repeating a "##" title, so everything else should be under "## Summary".
From that point on you can only use "###" titles and below.
Do not include anything in your response apart from the markdown summary requested.
