Format this summary of a Dungeons & Dragons session into Markdown.

You will also receive, as context, the compiled notes from all previous sessions. These notes contain Obsidian-style wikilinks such as `[[Fruit Town]]`. In your output, you are allowed—and encouraged—to add similar `[[link]]` or `[[link|display text]]` wikilinks wherever it makes sense.

Overall goals:

- Produce clean, readable Markdown for the current session summary.
- Enrich the text with Obsidian-style wikilinks that match the style and "vibe" of the previous session notes.

Rules about content and structure:

- Preserve the original order and high-level narrative flow. Do NOT reorder or omit events.
- You may make minimal edits to punctuation or sentence breaks to improve readability, but do not change the underlying facts.
- Do not invent new section titles or perform large-scale reorganization of the narrative.
- Only convert existing structural cues (explicit headings, obvious title lines, or clear blank-line-separated sections) into Markdown headings. If the input contains no headings or clear sections, leave the content as paragraphs.

Rules about wikilinks (`[[...]]`):

- These wikilinks will be used as Markdown links to other Obsidian notes.
- You are explicitly allowed to introduce new `[[...]]` links that were not present in the input.
- Add wikilinks where it feels natural that there could be a separate note or page—for example, for:
	- Named locations (e.g., towns, dungeons, planes, taverns).
	- Named NPCs, factions, gods, organizations, or recurring monsters.
	- Items, artifacts, quests, events, combats, puzzles, creatures, species, or plot arcs.
- When choosing link titles, follow the naming style and "vibe" you see in the previous session notes (e.g., `[[Fruit Town]]`, `[[The Bramble Court]]`, etc.).
- Do not over-link every single noun; prioritize entities that seem important enough to deserve their own page.
- You may wrap an existing name in `[[...]]` or, if needed for clarity, slightly normalize/spell out a name before linking (e.g., turning "Fruit town" into `[[Fruit Town]]`).
- Always add wikilinks to words that already have wikilinks in previous session notes. 

Required wrapper for the output:

- The output will be inserted under the section `## Summary` in a larger Markdown file. Therefore your response MUST begin with the exact line:

## Summary

- Do NOT include any other top-level `##` headings in your output. You may use `###` headings and lower-level Markdown elements (bold, italics, lists, code spans, paragraphs) only when those elements are directly supported by the original input (e.g., an existing heading or explicit list).
- Do not include any explanations, commentary, or metadata outside the Markdown itself.

Examples of allowed changes:

- Fixing a run-on sentence with a period and keeping both sentences intact.
- Turning an existing short title line into a `###` heading when the input already had a title.
- Wrapping a location name like "fruit town" as `[[Fruit Town]]` to match the linking style of earlier notes.

Disallowed changes:

- Creating new `###` headings that summarize or reorganize events when the original input had none.
- Removing, condensing, or expanding factual content.
- Adding commentary, suggestions, or external context outside of Obsidian-style wikilinks.

Output only the formatted Markdown starting with `## Summary` and nothing else.
