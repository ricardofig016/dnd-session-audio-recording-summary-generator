# C:/Users/LENOVO/Desktop/dnd/worlds/Finvora/Finvora/Sessions\Session 2 - The Regicide Mystery

## Summary

### Arrest and Incarceration

[[Party 1]] rested at the inn after their previous quest. They were subsequently arrested by guards ([[Fred]] and [[Gaspar]]) for leaving a wolf's head in a public area and were taken to the guardhouse to pay a fine and serve a two-night sentence.

### The Prison Explosion

Shortly after being locked in their cell, a large explosion rocked the prison, causing dust to fill the area, and marking the start of [[Evarnia's Explosion and Regicide Mystery]]. [[Kael Raval]] used his thieves' tools to pick the lock of his cell, freed himself, and then freed the rest of [[Party 1]] after they promised him refuge.

### Investigating the Town Center

[[Party 1]] followed the source of the explosion to the town center, finding a scene of destruction with injured citizens and burning buildings. They discovered the shop of [[Marta]] in ruins.

### Marta's Demise and a Magical Discovery

[[Marta]] was found mortally wounded and died despite healing attempts. Her cat was found hiding in the wreckage. [[Freya Moondancer]] found the [[Whisper Ring]] wrapped in a cloth on Marta's body, which felt "unlocked," unlike before.

### Rumors of Regicide

[[Party 1]] learned the explosion was caused by wine merchants who had recently arrived by boat. They also heard that king [[Folo Bergamuli]] had been assassinated in his castle. Guards believed the explosion was a diversion for the assassination.

### Discovery of the King's Body

[[Party 1]] went to the castle to investigate. They found the king's body in his study with his throat slit. The symbol of the [[Silencers]], an assassin's order, was written on the wall in blood, which [[Kael Raval]] recognized from his homeland.

### Interrogation of the Maid

They interrogated a maid named [[Dolga]], who claimed to have seen a figure in black fleeing the scene.

### Finding the Assassin's Escape Route

[[Party 1]] discovered a broken window with a rope leading down to the ground outside the castle, suggesting an escape route for the assassin.

### Discovery of Diplomatic Tensions

They also found transcripts of a recent meeting between King [[Folo Bergamuli]] and diplomats from a city called [[Beshkarl]]. The meeting involved a tense negotiation over taxes for ships passing through the [[Golden Strait]], which the king refused to split with [[Beshkarl]], citing their use of slavery and discrimination.

### The Wine Merchants' Flight

Investigating the port, [[Party 1]] spoke to a fisherman who reported that a boat full of wine merchants had departed suddenly just after the explosion. One of the merchants was seen boarding the boat shortly after the blast.

### Securing Lodgings for the Night

Appointed by [[Grilia]], [[Party 1]] spends the night in a servant's room ([[Frederica]]) in the castle to continue their investigation in the morning. [[Freya Moondancer]] took a book of meeting transcripts from the king's study.

# C:/Users/LENOVO/Desktop/dnd/worlds/Finvora/Finvora/Sessions\Session 3 - The Low City

## Summary

### Awakening in the Servant's Quarters

[[Party 1]] awoke in their servant's quarters in the castle. [[Freya Moondancer]] spent time gathering sand for her spell components. The group decided their next step was to find the scribe [[Miguel]], whom they had learned about from the meeting transcripts, to get more information on the recent diplomatic tensions with [[Beshkarl]].

### Learning of the Golden Strait Dispute from Miguel

[[Dolga]] lead [[Party 1]] to meet the scribe [[Miguel]] at his home. He provided more context on the recent meeting between King [[Folo Bergamuli|Folo]] and [[Loupi]] and the diplomats from [[Beshkarl]]. He confirmed the dispute was over tax revenue from the [[Golden Strait]], which the king refused to share with [[Beshkarl]] due to their use of slavery and discriminatory practices. Miguel described [[Beshkarl]] as a city built by dwarves, now divided into an upper city for the wealthy and a lower city (Low City) for the poor and criminals, reliant on slave labor. He also mentioned that from the port on a clear day, one can see [[Beshkarl]] across the strait.

### A Trade and Theft at Duarte's Blacksmith

[[Aranith Eanobra|Ara]] wanted to acquire a new weapon. [[Party 1]] went to a blacksmith named [[Duarte]], a dwarf. After some negotiation, which involved Freya using the Prestidigitation cantrip to clean the moss off his walls, Ara traded her Morningstar and 4 gold pieces for a Longsword. Kael used the distraction to stealthily steal a Glaive from the shop.

### Securing Passage with Fisherman [[Gumbroh]]

Seeking passage to [[Beshkarl]] to investigate the assassination further, [[Party 1]] went to the docks. They spoke with a fisherman named [[Gumbroh]], who, after some persuasion from [[Freya Moondancer|Freya]] (who offered their services as guards for his boat in lieu of payment), agreed to take them. The journey by boat took approximately two hours.

### Arrival in Low City and Reunion with Thorkell

Upon arriving in [[Beshkarl]]'s port, a crewmember guided [[Party 1]] through the city's backstreets to a safe house. They descended through a hidden hatch into the Low City. Kael, familiar with the city, led [[Party 1]] to the headquarters of his former assassin faction, the [[Blood Order]]. There, they met [[Thorkell]], Kael's former mentor and a high-ranking member of the faction.

### The Tournament Proposition

Thorkell revealed he could get them information on the [[Silencers]] (the assassins responsible for the king's death) but only if they participated in [[Thorkell's Unarmed Fighting Tournament]]. The prize for winning is either 100 gold pieces or a magic item. [[Party 1]] agreed to form two teams: Kael and Ara, and Fern and Freya. Their first matches are scheduled for later that day.

### Victory in the First Match Against [[Tilda & Lila]]

Kael and Ara fought their first match against the team [[Tilda & Lila]]. After a brief combat, Ara knocked one sister unconscious but chose to use her Lay on Hands ability to heal her slightly instead of killing her, causing both sisters to yield. [[Party 1]] won their first match.

The session ended with [[Party 1]] preparing for their next tournament match.

## Summary

### Victory in the Tournament Matches

[[Freya Moondancer|Freya]] & [[Elowen Fernwyn|Fern]] win vs [[Grimfist & Iliry]]
[[Kael Raval|Kael]] & [[Aranith Eanobra|Ara]] win vs [[Virba & Molo]]
[[Freya Moondancer|Freya]] & [[Elowen Fernwyn|Fern]] win vs [[Shkom & Shlom]]

Upon leaving the arena, [[Party 1]] was approached by an old woman who gave them two small sacks, each containing 5 Goodberries.

### Thorkell's Offer Regarding the Silencers

After the matches, [[Thorkell]] informed [[Party 1]] that if they reach the finals in the tournament, he will take them to meet a contact of his within the [[Silencers]], the assassin faction responsible for the king's death.

### Shopping in Low City

[[Party 1]] split up to explore shops in Low City:

*   **Blacksmith:** [[Kael Raval]] attempted to buy Studded Leather armor but found the prices inflated due to the blacksmith's anger at being woken up. She left without purchasing anything.

*   [[Gia's Secrets]]: [[Party 1]] found a mysterious, dark shop smelling of sulfur, run by a woman who offered fortunes and sold magic items. She showed them a Cloak of Billowing and a Staff of Adornment, but the prices were prohibitively high (e.g., 300 gold for a Ring of Cold Resistance). Kael again attempted to steal (the ring) but was caught by the shopkeeper's keen perception and [[Party 1]] was asked to leave.

### Declining the Blood Order's Contracts

[[Party 1]] returned to the [[Blood Order]] headquarters and spoke with the receptionist, looking for work. She offered two assassination contracts:

1.  A target in High City for 25 gold (a man who betrayed his wife).

2.  A contract to kill a group of 10 kobold children for 4 gold.

[[Party 1]] declined both contracts due to moral objections and poor pay.

### Learning Lore and Securing Work at the Mines

[[Party 1]] went to the mines seeking work. They spoke with a gnome receptionist who offered several jobs:

*   **Mining:** 2 copper per hour.
*   **Spider Extermination (Section C):** 1 gold per giant spider head and 2 copper per meter of webs cleared, with a 30 gold bonus for complete eradication.
*   **Troll Extermination (Section F):** 200 gold for killing a troll blocking a newly discovered area rumored to contain gold.
*   **Exploration & Mapping:** 2 gold per point of interest found.

The gnome also provided lore: The mines were built by dwarves centuries ago. It is suspected a passage to the [[Underdark]] might exist within them, and artifacts of dwarvish and elvish (Drow) make are sometimes found in the newer sections (E and F). He mentioned the closest known entrance to the Underdark is on the demonic island of [[Ulagaarth]].

### Exterminating Spiders in the Mines

[[Party 1]] took the spider extermination job. They fought and killed four Giant Spiders. [[Elowen Fernwyn|Fern]] was knocked unconscious during the fight. [[Party 1]] collected the spider heads as proof of the kill.

### Earning Rewards and Downtime Activities

[[Party 1]] earned 4 gold and 9 copper from the spider heads (1 gold per head). They then took a long rest at the [[Blood Order]] headquarters.

*   [[Freya Moondancer|Freya]] and [[Aranith Eanobra|Ara]] went to a tavern. Freya performed music, earning 15 copper and 8 silver, and both drank heavily.

*   [[Kael Raval|Kael]] and [[Elowen Fernwyn|Fern]] spent time training together, with Kael teaching stealth and Fern teaching acrobatics.

### [[Party 1]] Advances to Level 3

The session ended with [[Party 1]] completing a long rest and advancing to Level 3.

## Summary

### Victory in the Tournament Finals

[[Party 1]] fought and defeated [[Thalos & Noki]]. [[Kael Raval]] dealt the final blow to Thalos, knocking him unconscious. 
After the fight, [[Aranith Eanobra]] healed Noki with Lay on Hands. The old woman gave Ara another sack of 5 Goodberries.

In the next match, Freya used the Sleep spell on her opponents [[Meilavan & Rook]], winning the match almost instantly. 
[[Meilavan]] later revealed she was competing to win money for medicine for her sick mother, who suffers from a mysterious disease that turns the skin black and causes necrosis (this is caused by the after effects of the [[Eye of Yerkatraz]]).

[[Party 1]] won the tournament and chose the magic item prize.
They were presented with two options: the [Charlatan's Die](https://www.aidedd.org/magic-item/charlatan-s-die), and the [Coin of Delving](https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/wondrous-items:coin-of-delving). [[Party 1]] chose the **Charlatan's Die**, which [[Elowen Fernwyn]] attuned to during a subsequent short rest.

### Meeting with the Silencers

[[Thorkell]] took [[Party 1]] to meet his contact from the [[Silencers]], the assassin order responsible for the king's death.
The meeting occurred in a dark alley in Low City with the [[Silencers]]'s elder [[Brodlir]], a tall, thin man wearing a **rabbit mask**, accompanied by 2 [bodyguards](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/5195235-tough) and 4 [assassins](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/5174957-scout) on the rooftops.

[[Brodlir]] confirmed the Silencers killed the king but would not reveal that it was [[Skrudal]] who hired them.
He offered the information in exchange for [[Party 1]] delivering the [[Orb of Abjuration]] to an altar inside the [[Fort of Iraaki]].
He warned them not to touch the orb until it was time to place it and stated he would know if they succeeded.

Freya used *Detect Magic* on the orb and determined it was an **Abjuration** magic item with a powerful aura.

### Investigating the Black-Skinned Disease

After hearing about [[Meilavan]]'s mother, [[Party 1]] went to the [[Blood Order]]'s healer, [[Robuli]], to inquire about the disease.
[[Robuli]] was initially uncooperative but confirmed the disease is a magical curse or affliction, not a natural one. He stated there is no known cure, but the symptoms can be delayed using a tea made from **xuprino root**.

[[Party 1]] went to a nearby park, where they located and harvested several xuprino roots.

### Retrieving the Orb of Abjuration

[[Party 1]] traveled to the [[Fort of Iraaki]]. Kael scouted ahead, spotting four [skeletons](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/4775841-skeleton) in the main hall and a [gelatinous cube](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/5195005-gelatinous-cube) blocking a corridor, with two skeletons suspended inside it.

[[Party 1]] entered through a back window to avoid the cube. Fern, carrying the orb, climbed onto the central pedestal and placed the orb on the altar.

Upon placing the orb, a tremor shook the fortress, and [[Elowen Fernwyn]] was momentarily paralyzed by a surge of energy. The four skeletons animated and attacked.

After a brief combat, [[Party 1]] defeated the skeletons.

## Summary

### Ambushed by a Gelatinous Cube

While leaving the [[Fort of Iraaki]], [[Party 1]] was ambushed by the [Gelatinous Cube](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/5195005-gelatinous-cube) at the entrance. The cube was defeated, though [[Kael Raval]] was knocked unconscious and revived by Ara using a Goodberry. Investigation of two skeletons inside the cube yielded loot in very poor condition: a rusted, destroyed shield, a rusted shortsword, a rotten shortbow, and 2 silver pieces.

### Confronted by the Silencers on the Road

On the road back to Beshkarl, just outside the forest,  encountered two Silencer scouts, the same ones from the rooftops during the meeting with [[Brodlir]]. The assassins asked if the [[Orb of Abjuration]] had been placed. They then demanded [[Party 1]] retrieve the orb, reneging on [[Brodlir]]'s original deal. They refused, causing the assassins to become nervous. They fled into the forest, and the party chose not to pursue.

### Meilavan's Mother's Affliction

[[Party 1]] went to the docks to the home of [[Meilavan]]'s mother, [[Luela]]. The house was in a state of disarray and poverty. They found the mother unconscious in a locked bedroom, which was heavily damaged with scratches on the walls, broken furniture, a strong smell of decay, and a sealed window with wooden planks and nails.
[[Luela]]'s body was severely afflicted: almost bald, grey skin, black fingers, and with patches of raw flesh. [[Freya Moondancer]] cast Detect Magic and detected a powerful aura of **Necromancy** magic around the woman. 
[[Meilavan]] explained she locks the door at night because her mother once woke in a trance-like, violent state, and tried to kill her. 
Meilavan now sleeps in her master's attic for safety.

### Reunion with Magnus and a Grave Warning

The party, accompanied by Meilavan, went to see her master, the elderly wizard [[Magnus]], who was revealed to be a former companion and lover of [[Freya Moondancer]] from 90 years prior.
Magnus confirmed the mother's affliction is a powerful magical curse that his healing magic cannot affect.
He privately confided that the **xuprino root** tea is a "placebo of faith" and that the mother does not have much time left.

### The Eye of Yerkatraz

Magnus theorized the disease is linked to a powerful artifact: the [[Eye of Yerkatraz]]. The party's mention of the enchanted/necromancy-wolf near [[Evarnia]] led Magnus to note the curse is spreading to animals.
He gave Freya a **Scroll of Fireball**, urged the party to take [[Meilavan]] with them for her own good, and promised to try and develop a spell to counteract the curse if the party can find and bring him the cause.
As they left, Magnus gave Freya a grave warning: "I sense that the peaceful times we've had here for 300 years are about to end. Something very powerful has been released (referring to [[Velastra]]). Be careful."

### Preparations in Beshkarl

[[Party 1]] met with Thorkell at the Blood Order and informed him the Silencers had betrayed the deal. Thorkell offered to take the party to the Silencers' headquarters the next morning.
They decided to have Meilavan stay with her mother for now, planning to collect her when ready to leave the city to search for the Eye.
[[Elowen Fernwyn]] and [[Kael Raval]] used the **Charlatan's Die** to gamble and pickpocket in a tavern, Freya performed music, and Kael attempted to repair the equipment from the cube with little success, though he did manage to clean the shield to a usable state (+2 AC).
The party took a long rest.

## Summary

### The Rabbit Mask

Upon waking at the [[Blood Order]], the party was met by [[Thorkell]]. He presented them with [[Puzzle 3 - Runic Note from the Silencers]], a rabbit mask left at the door, a sign that [[Brodlir]] was dead. The mask was found to have a small purple crystal and a note with the [[Silencers]]' symbol inside. The party could not identify the crystal, and the note's meaning was encrypted in runes. Thorkell concluded that with Brodlir likely dead, their planned visit to the Silencers' headquarters would be fruitless, as no one would speak to them.

### Eradicating the Giant Spiders in Section C

[[Party 1]], proceeded to the [[Beshkarl's Ancient Dwarf Mines]] to eradicate the giant spiders in Section C, to earn money.
* They fought and defeated three giant spiders and an **Ettercap**.
* The party cleared the webbing and discovered the spiders' nest, destroying the remaining eggs.
* [[Kael Raval]] collected several hundred spider eggs in a bag.
* [[Aranith Eanobra]] harvested a small amount of potent black venom from the Ettercap's fangs.

### The Crystal Puzzle

The party entered Section E.

Exploring further, the party found [[Puzzle 2 - Rainbow Crystals]], a chamber with seven large, colored crystals that emitted a faint magical glow. By touching the crystals in the order of the rainbow (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet), they activated a mechanism. A wall slid away, revealing a shortcut that connected to a previously mapped area of the mines.

### Confrontation with the Drow

Using the new passage, the party encountered a group of ten drow scouts ([[Combat 2 - Drow Scouts]]). They were initially hostile and demanded the party leave their territory. Attempts at diplomacy by [[Freya Moondancer]] and [[Elowen Fernwyn]] failed. The party killed four drow, after which the remaining six fled down a set of stairs leading toward **Section F**.

### Loot from the Drow Camp

The party investigated the camp and found a locked chest, which Kael picked. Inside, they discovered:
* A map of Section F, written in Elvish, showing locations such as "Duergar Fortress," "Underdark," "Yeti," "Troll," and "Crystal Cave."
* **Alchemist's Supplies**.
* A magic **crystal** that grants advantage on Arcana checks while in Section E.
* 68 silver pieces.
* 2 **Potions of Healing**.
* A **Moon-Touched Rapier** (a +1 magic weapon that sheds moonlight).
* A **Potion of Hill Giant Strength** (sets Strength to 21 for 1 hour).

# C:/Users/LENOVO/Desktop/dnd/worlds/Finvora/Finvora/Sessions\Session 8 - Faerie Dragons and a Tp Circle

## Summary

### Overview

**Date:** 18th April 304
**Location:** [[Beshkarl's Ancient Dwarf Mines]], [[Section E]]
**Participants:** [[Party 1]]
**Main Events:**
- [[Party 1]] reached a massive chasm in [[Section E]].
- They were ambushed by four **Invisible [[Faerie Dragon]]s** ([[Combat 1 - Faerie Dragon]]).
- A difficult combat ensued, involving confusion effects and environmental danger.
- The party discovered and activated a **[[Teleportation Circle]]** [[Puzzle 1 - d20 Runes Teleportation Circle]].
- They decoded a runic note, revealing a passphrase.
- The session ended with the party deciding whether to enter the portal.

### Scene: The Precipice in Section E

[[Party 1]] arrived at a narrow stone walkway (2.5 meters wide) spanning a vast, dark chasm.

- **[[Kael Raval|Kael]]** threw a stone down the chasm. He heard an echo and a cracking sound, suggesting the bottom was far below and possibly icy.
- **[[Freya Moondancer|Freya]]** threw a torch down the right side. The torch revealed a sheer rock wall transitioning to a wall of ice far below, and went out upon impact.
- **[[Freya Moondancer|Freya]]** cast Firebolt upwards. The bolt traveled ~40 meters (120 feet) and revealed a body of water on the ceiling, held there by reversed gravity. She also noticed many small, crystal-like nooks in the walls, resembling nests.
- The party heard high-pitched, squeaking sounds and the flapping of wings but saw nothing.

### Combat: Ambush by Faerie Dragons

[[Combat 1 - Faerie Dragon]]

**Participants:** [[Aranith Eanobra|Ara]], [[Elowen Fernwyn|Fern]], [[Freya Moondancer|Freya]], [[Kael Raval|Kael]], [[Meilavan]] (NPC) vs. 4x Invisible [[Faerie Dragon]]s.

**Enemy Details:** Tiny, pink, crystalline dragons with insect-like wings. Can turn invisible and use a **Euphoria Breath** weapon (Wisdom save or become incapacitated and move randomly).

#### Loot from Combat

The party did not loot the [[Faerie Dragon]]s, as their bodies were not searched.

### Puzzle: The Teleportation Circle

After the combat, the party noticed a **[[Teleportation Circle]]** on the ground nearby. The circle was a hexagon with glowing runes and small, vibrating crystals.

- **[[Freya Moondancer|Freya]]** used **Detect Magic** and identified a strong aura of **Conjuration** magic.
- The party used **[[Puzzle 3 - Runic Note from the Silencers]]** (found in [[Session 7 - Webs and Crystals]] inside the rabbit mask) to decipher the runes

#### Deciphering the Runic Note

The note contained two phrases in a coded alphabet. The party successfully decoded it:

1.  `THE EYE WATCHES ALL WHO SPEAK`
2.  `TREASON IS PAID IN SILENCE`

They believed this was the passphrase for the [[Teleportation Circle]].

#### Activating the Circle

- **[[Freya Moondancer|Freya]]** attempted to connect to the circle magically and speak the passphrase: `"The eye watches all who speak. Treason is paid in silence."`
- The circle reacted: the lines glowed brightly, and the crystals vibrated before the light faded. The portal was now active.
- *The party speculated the circle might lead to the [[Silencers]]' headquarters or a dangerous location like a volcano. They were unsure if the destination was safe.*

### Planning: Party Discussion and Decision

The party debated their next move:

- **[[Kael Raval|Kael]]** and **[[Aranith Eanobra|Ara]]** wanted to go back to the mine's entrance to collect their monetary reward for clearing [[Section C]] [[Session 7 - Webs and Crystals]] and the new exploration.
- **[[Freya Moondancer|Freya]]** and **[[Elowen Fernwyn|Fern]]** were eager to enter the portal immediately.

The main point of contention was the risk of entering an unknown location without a guaranteed way back and without their full reward.

**Final Decision:** The session ended with the party on the verge of entering the portal, but no final decision was made in-character. Out-of-character, they agreed to resolve this at the start of the next session.

### Overview

**Date:** 18th April 304
**Location:** [[Beshkarl's Ancient Dwarf Mines]] ([[Section E]] [[Teleportation Circle]]) → [[Beshkarl]] ([[Low City]])
**Participants:** [[Aranith Eanobra|Ara]], [[Kael Raval|Kael]], [[Thorkell]] (NPC), [[Meilavan]] (NPC)
**Main Events:**
*   [[Kael Raval|Kael]] and [[Aranith Eanobra|Ara]] leave [[Freya Moondancer|Freya]] and [[Elowen Fernwyn|Fern]] at the [[Teleportation Circle]].
*   They exit the mines, report to [[Jorni]], collect rewards, and name their party "[[King's Army]]".
*   They visit [[Magnus]] to inquire about the portal; he is unable to determine its destination.
*   They meet [[Thorkell]] at the [[Blood Order]] headquarters and decide to infiltrate the [[Silencers]] hideout.
*   They successfully enter the hideout, discover historical lore, and are given the [[Orb of Abjuration]] by a member, [[Freshki]].
*   [[Kael Raval|Kael]] overhears a cryptic conversation about a powerful female figure who has "returned".
*   The group leaves the hideout and decides to return to the mines to use the portal.

### Scene: Departure from the Teleportation Circle

[[Kael Raval|Kael]] and [[Aranith Eanobra|Ara]] debated taking a [[Short Rest]] but decided against it. [[Freya Moondancer|Freya]] and [[Elowen Fernwyn|Fern]] told them to meet later at the [[Blood Order]] headquarters. [[Kael Raval|Kael]] and [[Aranith Eanobra|Ara]], accompanied by [[Meilavan]], left the two at the [[Teleportation Circle]] and headed for the mine's exit.

### Scene: Reporting to the Mine Receptionist

The party passed by the gnome receptionist, [[Jorni]]. He greeted them and mentioned that [[Freya Moondancer|Freya]] had already reported finding a portal and was paid for the party's mapping work. He asked for the party's name for his records. After some discussion, they decided on the name **"[[King's Army]]"** as a cover, alluding to the deceased king [[Folo Bergamuli]]. [[Jorni]] noted the name was strange but allowed it, paid them, and let them go.

### Scene: Consulting Magnus

The party went to [[Magnus]]'s home to ask if he knew about the [[Teleportation Circle]]. [[Aranith Eanobra|Ara]] described the portal and showed a drawing of the runes. [[Magnus]] examined it but concluded he could not determine where the portal led based on the drawing alone. He invited them inside to research, but the party declined and left to find [[Thorkell]].

### Scene: Planning with Thorkell

They found [[Thorkell]] at the [[Blood Order]] headquarters. They updated him: [[Freya Moondancer|Freya]] and [[Elowen Fernwyn|Fern]] had entered the portal, and they suspected it led to the [[Silencers]]. He theorized that [[Brodlir]] was killed by someone higher up in the Silencers for talking to outsiders. The group decided to infiltrate the Silencers' hideout first, as they were already in the city. [[Thorkell]] agreed to lead them.

### Scene: Infiltrating the Silencers' Hideout

[[Thorkell]] led them to a butcher shop that served as a front. Inside, he gave a passphrase to the butcher, who revealed a secret door. They entered a narrow tunnel in the stone.

### Exploration: The Corrupted Shrine

The first chamber contained a shrine that had been deliberately corrupted with dark runes. [[Aranith Eanobra|Ara]]'s Divine Sense detected its evil nature. She investigated and determined the desecration was recent and weak. She prayed and used a religious rite to purify and reconsecrate the shrine, for which she was granted **Heroic Inspiration**.

### Exploration: The Library and Records Room

The party found a small library. [[Aranith Eanobra|Ara]] and [[Meilavan]] searched a bookshelf and found a book titled ***"The Great War: The Tieflings' Side."*** It contained lore about the war, the expulsion of tieflings to the [[Dark Continent]], an ice wall in [[Fliobara]], and powerful Tiefling warriors sealed in the caverns of [[Arora]]. [[Kael Raval|Kael]] examined a logbook on a lectern; the last entry confirmed **Brodlir** was "Silenced" for selling the order's secrets. [[Kael Raval|Kael]] stole the logbook.

### Social: Encounter with [[Freshki]]

A young, skinny [[Silencers]] member entered. 
He said in thief's Cant:
- estamos a ser ouvidos
- fui eu que vos dei a máscara dele
- "a chefa" quer a orb, levem-na, protejam-na
- se ficar aqui mais tempo, morro
- "ela" sabe que voces estao aqui
- boa sorte, não me tentem procurar
He handed over the **[[Orb of Abjuration]]**. [[Kael Raval|Kael]] took the orb and asked in Thieves' Cant about a teleportation circle in the hideout; the young man said he didn't know of one. He warned them not to be late "or she'll get angry," then left.

### Exploration: Scouting Ahead and Overhearing a Conversation

[[Kael Raval|Kael]] scouted ahead stealthily to a common room with a sewer river, where two Silencers were talking. He overheard a fragment: *"They say she fought in the war... 300 years ago... She seems so young... By the beasts, she was sealed in [[Erora]] and now she's returned... But why is she commanding this now?..."* [[Kael Raval|Kael]] returned and reported this. [[Aranith Eanobra|Ara]] recalled the war was 300 years ago between humans and tieflings, but the detail about [[Erora]] was new.

### Scene: Exit and Aftermath

The group left the hideout. They passed the butcher, and [[Kael Raval|Kael]] successfully acted normally. Once outside, they reasoned their companions were not in the hideout and must have gone through the portal. **Decision:** The group decided to return to the [[Beshkarl's Ancient Dwarf Mines]] and use the [[Teleportation Circle]] to find [[Freya Moondancer|Freya]] and [[Elowen Fernwyn|Fern]].

## Summary

### Overview

**Date:** 18th April 304
**Location:** Entrance of [[Beshkarl's Ancient Dwarf Mines]], [[Low City]]
**Participants:** [[Aranith Eanobra|Ara]], [[Elowen Fernwyn|Fern]], [[Freya Moondancer|Freya]], [[Kael Raval|Kael]], [[Meilavan]]

### Scene: Reporting to Jorni at the Mine Entrance

**Location:** Entrance of [[Beshkarl's Ancient Dwarf Mines]]
**Participants:** [[Freya Moondancer|Freya]], [[Elowen Fernwyn|Fern]], [[Jorni]]

[[Freya Moondancer|Freya]] and [[Elowen Fernwyn|Fern]] speak with the gnome receptionist, [[Jorni]]. He greets them and informs them that their friends ([[Kael Raval|Kael]] and [[Aranith Eanobra|Ara]]) have already left. He mentions that [[Freya Moondancer|Freya]] reported finding a portal and was paid for the party's mapping work. [[Jorni]] asks for the party's official name for his records. [[Freya Moondancer|Freya]] and [[Elowen Fernwyn|Fern]] explain they haven't decided on a name. [[Jorni]] reveals that based on [[Kael Raval|Kael]] and [[Aranith Eanobra|Ara]]'s earlier conversation, he has registered them as **"[[King's Army]]"**. [[Elowen Fernwyn|Fern]] is visibly displeased with this name, suspecting [[Kael Raval|Kael]] suggested it. [[Jorni]] confirms the registration but notes the name is strange.

### Scene: Discussing the Giant Hand with Jorni

**Location:** Entrance of [[Beshkarl's Ancient Dwarf Mines]]
**Participants:** [[Freya Moondancer|Freya]], [[Elowen Fernwyn|Fern]], [[Jorni]]

[[Freya Moondancer|Freya]] informs [[Jorni]] about the [[Severed Storm Giant Hand]] left in the mine. She describes it as a very large, severed hand. [[Jorni]] recognizes it as belonging to a **[[Storm Giant]]**. [[Freya Moondancer|Freya]] asks how they can remove it from the mine. [[Jorni]] states that, as a point of interest found in the mines, the hand technically belongs to the mining council, not the party. [[Freya Moondancer|Freya]] argues that she was the one who severed it. [[Jorni]] acknowledges this is a good point and suggests they could reach an agreement where the party gets a 20% of the profit if he sells it on their behalf.

### Scene: Party Reunion and Information Exchange

**Location:** Entrance of [[Beshkarl's Ancient Dwarf Mines]]
**Participants:** [[Aranith Eanobra|Ara]], [[Elowen Fernwyn|Fern]], [[Freya Moondancer|Freya]], [[Kael Raval|Kael]], [[Meilavan]]

[[Kael Raval|Kael]] and [[Aranith Eanobra|Ara]] arrive at the mine entrance, reuniting with [[Freya Moondancer|Freya]] and [[Elowen Fernwyn|Fern]]. [[Kael Raval|Kael]] jokingly scolds [[Freya Moondancer|Freya]] for having a poor memory about already splitting money. [[Freya Moondancer|Freya]] and [[Elowen Fernwyn|Fern]] begin recounting their experience through the [[Teleportation Circle]] in [[Session 9.1 - Velastra's Lab]].

[[Kael Raval|Kael]] and [[Aranith Eanobra|Ara]] share their own discoveries from infiltrating the [[Silencers]] hideout in [[Session 9.2 - Silencer's Hideout]].

### Scene: Debating the Party Name and Lore Implications

**Location:** Entrance of [[Beshkarl's Ancient Dwarf Mines]]
**Participants:** [[Aranith Eanobra|Ara]], [[Elowen Fernwyn|Fern]], [[Freya Moondancer|Freya]], [[Kael Raval|Kael]]

The [[Party 1]] debates the registered name **"[[King's Army]]"**. [[Elowen Fernwyn|Fern]] dislikes it, but [[Kael Raval|Kael]] argues it's just for this region and they can change it later. The party discusses the newly uncovered lore. [[Aranith Eanobra|Ara]] reveals she knows little about the war, as her tribe never spoke of it. She is a blue tiefling who left her home on the [[Dark Continent]] by boat as a teenager. [[Freya Moondancer|Freya]] recalls that the elves deliberately remained neutral in the war.

The party speculates on the identity and motives of the new [[Silencers]] leader (the blue tiefling). They connect her to the enchanted/necromancy wolf from [[Session 1 - The First Boss]], recalling the telepathic voice that said "You will pay for this!" and "How could you betray us like this?" to [[Aranith Eanobra|Ara]]. They theorize this tiefling seeks vengeance against humans, which might explain the magical disease ([[Eye of Yerkatraz|black skin curse]]) affecting humans in [[Beshkarl]]. They wonder if killing her would lift the curse, or if it is permanent. They discuss the possibility that the [[Teleportation Circle]] in the mines was created by the [[Silencers]] to access her prison and free her.

### Social: Negotiating a Deal for the Giant Hand

**Location:** Entrance of [[Beshkarl's Ancient Dwarf Mines]]
**Participants:** [[Freya Moondancer|Freya]], [[Elowen Fernwyn|Fern]], [[Jorni]]

[[Freya Moondancer|Freya]] and [[Elowen Fernwyn|Fern]] negotiate a contract with [[Jorni]] for the sale of the [[Severed Storm Giant Hand]]. [[Freya Moondancer|Freya]] wants her name (and [[Elowen Fernwyn|Fern]]'s) associated with the deed for potential fame. [[Jorni]] explains he will sell it on the black market, where names are rarely known. They agree that [[Jorni]] will handle the sale and the party will receive **20%** of the profit. [[Jorni]] asks for their names for the contract. [[Freya Moondancer|Freya]] gives her name.

### Scene: Post-Discussion Planning and Paranoia

**Location:** Path from the Mines to [[Low City]] center
**Participants:** [[Aranith Eanobra|Ara]], [[Elowen Fernwyn|Fern]], [[Freya Moondancer|Freya]], [[Kael Raval|Kael]]

The [[Party 1]] leaves the mine entrance, heading back toward the city. [[Aranith Eanobra|Ara]], who is carrying the [[Orb of Abjuration]], becomes paranoid that the [[Silencers]] leader might be scrying on them. She does not notice anyone specifically watching her. The party checks the time; it is roughly midday. They discuss their next steps. [[Elowen Fernwyn|Fern]] wants to retrieve her cat, Onyx, from [[Meilavan]]. [[Kael Raval|Kael]] suggests going to the [[Blood Order]] for new contracts, but others recall the previously offered contracts were morally objectionable. [[Freya Moondancer|Freya]] wants to visit [[Magnus]] to research the lore they've found, particularly in the book [[Kael Raval|Kael]] took.

**In-Game Decision:** The party decides their immediate goal is to visit [[Magnus]] to share information and conduct research. [[Elowen Fernwyn|Fern]] retrieves her cat from [[Meilavan]]. The session ends with the party heading toward [[Magnus]]'s home.

### Planning: Party Debate on Conflicting Goals
**Location:** Low City Streets
The party discusses their new, conflicting objectives:
- **[[Aranith Eanobra|Ara]]:** Wants to travel **north** to find her brother.
- **[[Kael Raval|Kael]]:** Wants to travel **south** to intercept his father (the king).
- **[[Freya Moondancer|Freya]]:** Wants to find/rescue her friend **Trug**.
- **[[Elowen Fernwyn|Fern]]:** Has no specific lead.
They argue over whose goal is more urgent.

### Social: Consulting Thorkell at the Blood Order
**Location:** [[Blood Order]] Headquarters, Low City
The party updates [[Thorkell]] on the prophecies. [[Freya Moondancer|Freya]] shows him the stolen meeting transcript. [[Thorkell]] agrees that [[Beshkarl]] is "built on slavery and discrimination," explaining that [[Low City]] residents are essentially enslaved for [[High City]]. He offers to gather more information on the king's movements within 24 hours.

### Scene: Research at Magnus's Home
**Location:** [[Magnus]]'s Home, Docks District
The party goes to [[Magnus]] for research. He gives them **45 minutes** with three books:

#### Research Findings:
*   **Mythical Creatures:** [[Storm Giant]]s live in the deep ocean or on magical clouds. Dragons are divided into True Dragons (Chromatics, Metallics, Gem), Miscellaneous Dragons, and Lesser Dragons.
*   **Geography of Yekrataez:** The [[Fort of Iraaki]] is believed to have a large dungeon underneath. The [[Dwarven Hills]] are a massive east-west barrier infested with giants and monsters.
*   **How to Survive a Dragon:** Contains general advice and has an inlaid, glowing **silver dragon scale** on its cover.

[[Freya Moondancer|Freya]] shows [[Magnus]] the book ***"The Great War: The Tieflings' Side."*** [[Magnus]] proposes a trade for his Mythical Creatures book, but the party declines.

### Aftermath: Evening Decisions
**Location:** Streets of Low City
The party leaves [[Magnus]]'s home. It is now nightfall and the **[[Fire Festival]]** is about to begin.
